      <description>TL;DR: The objective of this post is to reflect on how we write and to set up a template to reuse in future blog posts.
 Tips for blog post writing Writing research papers is not the same as writing academic blogs. The former is more prescriptive, limited to a number of characters, and usually constrained to 4-5 figures and tables (sure, we can go crazy in the supplementary material, but there’s a reason why it’s supplementary … ).</description>

      <description>  This page will be updated continuously to highlight functions, packages, and presentations useful for R users.
It will generally contain a brief description and links to tutorials or vignettes.
If there’s something I’d love for you to learn more about I will create a separate blog post.
Keep an eye out!

      <description>Aim The purpose of this markdown is to generate my own page and document the process for peers in my research group and others.
 Scope In this document I will be following Allison Hill’s Up &amp;amp; running with blogdown in 2021 post. The steps here deviate a bit from her proposed 7 step guide, but I used it as a starting point. I will provide my own commentary and experience deploying a website from R for the first time.</description>

      <title>Antimicrobial Resistance in DWS</title>

      <description>Summary     Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in drinking water has received less attention than its counterparts in the urban water cycle. While culture-based techniques or gene-centric PCR have been used to probe the impact of treatment approaches (e.g., disinfection) on AMR in drinking water, to our knowledge there is no systematic comparison of AMR trait distribution and prevalence between disinfected and disinfectant residual-free drinking water systems. We used metagenomics to assess the associations between disinfectant residuals and AMR prevalence and its host association in full-scale drinking water distribution systems (DWDSs) with and without disinfectant residuals.</description>

      <description>Summary     Loss of basic utilities, such as drinking water and electricity distribution, were sustained for months in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria&amp;rsquo;s (HM) landfall in Puerto Rico (PR) in September 2017. The goal of this study was to assess if there was deterioration in biological quality of drinking water due to these disruptions. This study characterized the microbial composition of drinking water following HM across nine drinking water systems (DWSs) in PR and utilized an extended temporal sampling campaign to determine if changes in the drinking water microbiome were indicative of HM associated disturbance followed by recovery.</description>
