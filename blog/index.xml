      <description>TL;DR: The objective of this post is to reflect on how we write and to set up a template to reuse in future blog posts.
 Tips for blog post writing Writing research papers is not the same as writing academic blogs. The former is more prescriptive, limited to a number of characters, and usually constrained to 4-5 figures and tables (sure, we can go crazy in the supplementary material, but there’s a reason why it’s supplementary … ).</description>

      <description>  This page will be updated continuously to highlight functions, packages, and presentations useful for R users.
It will generally contain a brief description and links to tutorials or vignettes.
If there’s something I’d love for you to learn more about I will create a separate blog post.
Keep an eye out!

      <description>Aim The purpose of this markdown is to generate my own page and document the process for peers in my research group and others.
 Scope In this document I will be following Allison Hill’s Up &amp;amp; running with blogdown in 2021 post. The steps here deviate a bit from her proposed 7 step guide, but I used it as a starting point. I will provide my own commentary and experience deploying a website from R for the first time.</description>
