<h2>Aim</h2>
<p>In this blogpost, I will review foundational concepts underlying co-occurrence networks and apply them to <strong>visualize</strong> a drinking water metagenome dataset.</p>

<h2>Scope</h2>
<p>The information discussed in the “Background” section is in part a summary of the “Graph Theory for Data Science” workshop series taught by Stanford University PhD student <a href="https://github.com/juliaolivieri">Julia Olivieri</a>, as a part of <a href="https://www.widsconference.org/workshops.html">Women in data science workshop series</a>. Her workshops are available on youtube and consist of the three parts:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Part I: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlzWjdaXYgA">What is a graph and What Can We Do With It?</a></p></li>
<li><p>Part II: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45jNuN4DtPM&amp;list=PLHAk3jHXWpxI7fHw8m5PhrpSRpR3NIjQo&amp;index=3">Graph Algorithms: Traversing the tree and beyond</a></p></li>
<li><p>Part III: <a href="">Characterizing Graphs in the Real World</a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>In May 2019, I was one of the workshop organizers for Meta-omics in Environmental Engineering Research at the Association of Environmental Engineering and Science Professors (AEESP) conference. The slides I presented there are shared within this post as well.</p>
<p>Additionally, the plugging <a href="https://doi.org/doi:%2010.12688/f1000research.9050.2">CoNet</a> in the Cytoscape application will be used to infer associations between metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) from drinking water systems.</p>
<p>The main objective of this post is to use R packages to describe and visualize the network.</p>
</div>
<div id="background" class="section level2">
<h2>Background</h2>
<p><strong>Graphs</strong> are structures that represent relationships between things.</p>
<p>The formal definition of a graph, G is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
G = (v,E)
\]</span></p>
<p>the set of <strong>vertices</strong>, v (i.e., nodes), and <strong>edges</strong>, E (i.e., links) such that v is finite and non-empty and each element of E is a two-element subset of v.</p>
<p>In order to describe the topology of the graph we rely on different scores. Centrality measures, for example, are useful to determine the importance of nodes and edges compared to the remaining components of the graph.</p>
<div class="panelset">
<div class="panel">
<p><span class="panel-name">Definitions</span></p>
<p>At the most basic level, the <strong>degree</strong> of a vertex gives an indication of how “central” it is, and how it connects to others. We just count the connections to a node and voila. This is a local measure that is easy to calculate and high degree nodes are considered “hubs”. However, the inability to uniquely rank nodes is very likely.</p>
<p>Alternatively, global connectivity measures consider the node’s neighbors. One such measure is <strong>eigencentrality</strong> (i.e., eigenvector centrality). This score accounts for the degree of the node as well as the degree of connected nodes (i.e., neighbors). The relative centrality score of vertex v with neighbor t can be defined as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
x_v = \frac{1}{\lambda}\sum_{t{\in}M(v)}x_t
\]</span></p>
<p>where M(v) is a set of the neighbors of v and is a constant.</p>
<p>Other global scores that are more widely used are <strong>closeness centrality</strong> and <strong>betweenness centrality</strong>, both of which rely on path length information. <strong>Closeness centrality</strong> is a measure of how close a vertex is to the other vertices by summing the shortest path distances. Formally,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\frac{N-1}{\sum_{j}  d(i,j)}
\]</span></p>
<p>where N is the number of nodes. It is the reciprocal of the average shortest path length.</p>
<p>Alternatively, <strong>betweenness centrality</strong> scores place emphasis on the shortest path a node is part of. Higher scores correspond to nodes that are gatekeepers of information flow. It is defined as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\sum_{j&lt;k}  \frac{g_{jk}(n_i)} {g_{jk}}
\]</span></p>
</div>
<div class="panel">
<p><span class="panel-name">Vocabulary</span></p>
<ul>
<li>walk: sequence of vertices connected by edges.</li>
<li>trail: walk with no repeated edges.</li>
<li>cycle: non-empty trail that starts and ends at the same vertex.</li>
<li>connected: if a vertex can be reached from any other vertex through a walk.</li>
<li>tree: a connected graph that doesn’t contain any cycles.</li>
<li>degree: number of edges connected to vertex.</li>
<li>sub-graph: subset of vertices and corresponding edges.</li>
<li>complete graph: contains an edge between every pair of vertices (degree of each vertex in n-1, where n is the number of vertices).</li>
<li>clique: the largest complete sub-graph.</li>
<li>adjacency matrix: matrix with rows and columns labeled by graph vertices, with a 1 or 0 in position (v_i,v_j) according to whether v_i and v_j are adjacent or not.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<p>There are multiple types of graphs that we might be familiarized with. For example, <strong>phylogenetic trees</strong> show ancestral relationships between taxa, <strong>chemical structures</strong> show connection between molecules, and <strong>co-occurrence networks</strong> are representations of the relationships between biological entities within a context. In this post, I will be describing the co-ocurrence network of metagenomes from drinking water systems.</p>
<p>There are a few tools at our disposal for co-occurrence inference from sequencing data, but I’m more familiar with <a href="https://psbweb05.psb.ugent.be/conet/index.php"><strong>CoNet</strong></a>. This tool detects non-random patterns of co-occurrence in presence/absence and abundance data based on user selected thresholds.</p>
<p>The general workflow is:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Preprocessing</p>
<p>raw data matrix is processed by removing rare taxa, and normalizing counts</p></li>
<li><p>Edge score computation</p>
<p>pairwise scoring using a range of measures (i.e., ensemble method) to capture different types of relationships</p></li>
<li><p>Significance assessment</p>
<p>Computation of p-value using a Z-test, comparing the permutation distribution mean given the bootstrap distribution</p></li>
</ol>
<p>CoNet runs on command line and as a <a href="http://www.cytoscape.org/">Cytoscape</a> plugin, there is also an <a href="https://github.com/ramellose/CoNetinR">R implementation</a>, but is not on CRAN or continuously maintained.</p>

<p>In this network, positive and negative type interactions are colored green and red, respectively.</p>
<p>I’ve also created <a href="https://pintolab.shinyapps.io/CoNet/">this</a> shiny app to play with the network’s layout. Take a look!</p>
<p>From the network graph we can see that there are two large components (or clusters), in fact 71.12% of the MAGs are part of those clusters.</p>
<p>We will now hone in on these nodes by creating two connected sub-graphs.</p>

<p>As discussed in the <a href="#background"><strong>??</strong></a> section, we can use centrality measures to describe node importance.</p>

<p>The MAGs with largest degrees correspond to DW01178 and DW00270, DW00626 in cluster 1 and 2, respectively. However, we know that degree alone is not the best metric for node importance. Let’s take a look at global metrics of centrality.</p>
<p>The highest ranking MAGs for each metric in terms of centrality are</p>
